### 4. Making the transfer

Now you can use **ANY** crypto wallet to send the selected asset to your deposit address. `ETH` in this case.

### 5. Receive the `k` tokens

Once we verify the deposit you will receive the tokens in your wallet. You may need to manually add them to Metamask. See this guide to add a `k` token to your metamask [How to view/see your tokens (custom tokens) in Metamask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031)
